                          CalDAV Notifications              January 2012


1.  Introduction

   CalDAV [RFC4791] provides a way for calendar users to store calendar
   data and exchange this data via scheduling operations.  Based on the
   WebDAV [RFC4918] protocol, it also includes the ability to manage
   access to calendar data via the WebDAV ACL [RFC3744] extension.

   It is often useful for servers to communicate arbitrary information
   to calendar users, e.g., system status, message of the day, quota
   warnings, changes to shared resources made by others etc.  This
   specification defines a generic "notification" mechanism that allows
   a server to do that.  Whilst primarily aimed at CalDAV [RFC4791],
   this mechanism has been designed to be adaptable to WebDAV [RFC4918].


2.  Open Issues

   1.  Define specific child elements for system status notification,
       e.g. "server-maintenance-period", "server-read-only-period",
       "client-upgrade-required".


3.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   When XML element types in the namespaces "DAV:" and
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav" are referenced in this document
   outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string "DAV:" and
   "CALDAV:" will be prefixed to the element type names respectively.

   The namespace "http://calendarserver.org/ns/" is used for XML
   elements defined in this specification.  When XML element types in
   that namespace are referenced in this document outside of the context
   of an XML fragment, the string "CS:" will be prefixed to the element
   type names.


4.  Notifications

   When this feature is available, a CS:notification-URL (Section 4.1.1)
   property appears on principal resources for those principals who are
   able to receive notifications.  That property specifies a single DAV:
   href element whose content refers to a WebDAV collection resource.
   Notification "messages" are deposited into this collection and can be
   retrieved by clients and acted on accordingly.



Daboo                                                           [Page 2]

                          CalDAV Notifications              January 2012


   The notification collection referenced by the CS:notification-URL
   (Section 4.1.1) property MUST have a DAV:resourcetype property with
   DAV:collection and CS:notifications (Section 4.3.1) child elements.

   Notification "messages" are XML documents stored as resources in the
   notification collection.  Each XML document contains a CS:
   notification (Section 4.3.2) element as its root.  The root element
   contains a CS:dtstamp element, a CS:uid element, and one additional
   element which represents the type of notification being conveyed in
   the message.  That child element will typically contain additional
   content that describes the notification.

   Each notification resource has a CS:notificationtype (Section 4.2.1)
   property which contains as its single child element an empty element
   that matches the child element of the notification resource XML
   document root.  Any attributes on the child element in the XML
   document are also present in the property child element.

   Notifications are automatically generated by the server (perhaps in
   response to a action) with an appropriate resource stored in the
   notifications collection of the user to whom the notification is
   targeted.  Clients SHOULD monitor the notification collection looking
   for new notification resources.  When doing so, clients SHOULD look
   at the CS:notificationtype (Section 4.2.1) property to ensure that
   the notification is of a type that the client can handle.  Once a
   client has handled the notification in whatever way is appropriate it
   SHOULD delete the notification resource.  Clients SHOULD remove
   notifications being displayed to a user when the notification
   resource is removed from the notification collection, to enable the
   user to dismiss a notification on one device and have it
   automatically removed from others.  Clients MUST ignore all
   notifications for types they do not recognize.  Servers MAY delete
   notification resources on their own if they determine that the
   notifications are no longer relevant or valid.  Servers MAY coalesce
   notifications as appropriate.

   Servers MUST prevent clients from adding resources in the
   notification collection.

4.1.  Additional Principal Properties

   This section defines new properties for WebDAV principal resources as
   defined in RFC3744 [RFC3744].  These properties are likely to be
   protected but the server MAY allow them to be written by appropriate
   users.

                          CalDAV Notifications              January 2012


4.1.1.  CS:notification-URL Property

   Name:  notification-URL

   Namespace:  http://calendarserver.org/ns/

   Purpose:  Identify the URL of the notification collection owned by
      the associated principal resource.

   Protected:  This property SHOULD be protected.

   PROPFIND behavior:  This property SHOULD NOT be returned by a
      PROPFIND allprop request (as defined in Section 14.2 of
      [RFC4918]).

   COPY/MOVE behavior:  This property value SHOULD be preserved in COPY
      and MOVE operations.

   Description:  This property is needed for a client to determine where
      the notification collection of the current user is located so that
      processing of notification messages can occur.  If not present,
      then the associated calendar user is not enabled for notification
      messages on the server.

   Definition:

   <!ELEMENT notification-URL (DAV:href)>

4.2.  Properties on Notification Resources

   The following new WebDAV properties are defined for notification
   resources.

4.2.1.  CS:notificationtype Property

   Name:  notificationtype

   Namespace:  http://calendarserver.org/ns/

   Purpose:  Identify the type of notification of the corresponding
      resource.

   Protected:  This property MUST be protected.

   PROPFIND behavior:  This property SHOULD NOT be returned by a
      PROPFIND allprop request (as defined in Section 14.2 of
      [RFC4918]).




Daboo                                                           [Page 4]

                          CalDAV Notifications              January 2012


   COPY/MOVE behavior:  This property value MUST be preserved in COPY
      and MOVE operations.

   Description:  This property allows a client, via a PROPFIND Depth:1
      request, to quickly find notification messages that the client can
      handle in a notification collection.  The single child element is
      the notification resource root element's child defining the
      notification itself.  This element MUST be empty, though any
      attributes on the element in the notification resource MUST be
      present in the property element.

   Definition:

   <!ELEMENT notificationtype ANY>
   <!-- Child elements are empty but will have appropriate attributes.
        Any valid notification message child element can appear.-->

4.3.  XML Element Definitions

4.3.1.  CS:notifications

   Name:  notifications

   Namespace:  http://calendarserver.org/ns/

   Purpose:  Indicates a notification collection.

   Description:  This XML element is used in a DAV:resourcetype element
      to indicate that the corresponding resource is a notification
      collection.

   Definition:

   <!ELEMENT notifications EMPTY>

4.3.2.  CS:notification

   Name:  notification

   Namespace:  http://calendarserver.org/ns/

   Purpose:  Notification message root element.

   Description:  The root element used in notification resources.

                          CalDAV Notifications              January 2012


   Definition:

   <!ELEMENT notification (dtstamp, uid, XXX) >
   <!-- Any notification type element can appear after
        CS:dtstamp -->

4.3.3.  CS:dtstamp

   Name:  dtstamp

   Namespace:  http://calendarserver.org/ns/

   Purpose:  Date-time stamp.

   Description:  Contains the date-time stamp corresponding to the
      creation of a notification message.

   Definition:

   <!ELEMENT dtstamp (#PCDATA)>

4.3.4.  CS:uid

   Name:  uid

   Namespace:  http://calendarserver.org/ns/

   Purpose:  Unique identifier for a notification.

   Description:  Contains the unique identifier for a notification
      message.  In some situation a server might update an existing
      notification with new information (e.g., when coalescing), but the
      server might create a new resource and delete the old one.
      However, clients will likely want to track this change as an
      update rather than a deletion and creation of a new notification.
      To aid that servers MUST include a unique identifier in the CS:uid
      element in the notification to allow clients to track notification
      updates.

   Definition:

   <!ELEMENT uid (#PCDATA)>


5.  Notification Definitions

   This section defines a set of common notification types.

                          CalDAV Notifications              January 2012


5.1.  System Status Notification

   The system status notification is used to convey a URI and/or textual
   description to the user.  The assumption is that the URI points to a
   webpage where current system status is described in detail, with the
   provided description being a summary of that.  A "type" attribute on
   the element is used to indicate the importance of the current status
   notification, and has the values "low", "medium" and "high",
   representing the increasing level of importance of the message
   respectively.

   Servers might have knowledge of specific calendar user language
   preferences, in which case it MAY localise the CS:description value
   as appropriate based on the calendar user accessing the notification,
   but if it does, it SHOULD include an xml:lang attribute on the CS:
   description element to indicate what language is being used.

5.1.1.  CS:systemstatus Element Definition

   Name:  systemstatus

   Namespace:  http://calendarserver.org/ns/

   Purpose:  Indicates a system status notification.

   Description:  This XML element is used in a CS:notification element
      to describe a system status notification.

   Definition:

   <!ELEMENT systemstatus (DAV:href?, CS:description?)>
   <!ATTLIST systemstatus type (low | medium | high) "low">

     <!ELEMENT description CDATA>

   <!-- One of DAV:href of CS:description MUST be present -->

   Example:  This is an example of the body of a notification resource
      for an emergency system outage:

     <CS:systemstatus type="high" />
   </CS:notificationtype>

5.2.  Quota Notification

   The quota notification is used to convey information about the status
   of one or more quotas for the user.  The notification contains
   elements for different types of quota being reported to the user.  In
   some cases these may be warnings (e.g., a user getting to 80% of
   their quota limit), or in other cases errors (e.g., a user exceeding
   their quota).

5.2.1.  CS:quotastatus Element Definition

   Name:  quotastatus

   Namespace:  http://calendarserver.org/ns/

   Purpose:  Indicates a quota status notification.

   Description:  This XML element is used in a CS:notification element
      to describe a quota status notification.  The CS:quota-percent-
      used element contains an integer greater than or equal to zero.
      If the value is greater than or equal to 100, then the user's
      quota has been reached or exceeded.  The DAV:href element contains
      a URI for a webpage where the user can go to get further
      information about their quota status or take corrective action.

     <!ELEMENT quota-percent-used CDATA>
     <!-- Integer value greater than or equal to zero -->

     <!ELEMENT quota-count CDATA>
     <!-- Integer value greater than or equal to zero -->

5.3.  Resource Changes Notification

   The resource change notification is used to inform the user of new,
   updated or deleted resources caused by changes made by someone else
   (note: servers MUST NOT generate notifications to users for changes
   they themselves make, though the possibility of an automated process
   acting on behalf of a user needs to be considered).  This
   notification can be used by clients to show changes that a user can
   acknowledge in their own time.  When the notification is present, it
   can be displayed on all devices a user is accessing their data from.
   When the user acknowledges and dismisses the notification on one
   device, other devices SHOULD also remove the notification when they
   next synchronize the notification collection.

   A new WebDAV property CS:notify-changes (Section 5.3.4) is defined
   for calendar collections.  This allows users to enable or disable the
   sending of resource change notifications for the calendar and its
   child resources.  Servers MUST allow users to set this property on a
   per-user basis on any calendars accessible to them.  Servers MUST
   honor the chosen setting to enable or disable change notifications.

   Servers can send notifications for calendar object resources, and
   ones for calendar collections.

5.3.1.  CS:resource-change Element Definition

                          CalDAV Notifications              January 2012


   Name:  resource-change

   Namespace:  http://calendarserver.org/ns/

   Purpose:  Indicates that resources have been created, updated or
      deleted.

   Description:  This XML element is used in a CS:notification element
      to describe a resource changes notification.  It can contain CS:
      created, CS:updated, CS:deleted elements each of which indicates a
      created, updated or deleted resource, respectively.  The DAV:href
      element within those three elements, contain the URI of the
      changed resource, optional information about who changed the
      resource and when that change was made (the CS:changed-by
      element), and information specific to the nature of the change.
      Servers SHOULD coalesce resource change notifications for the same
      resource into a single notification resource.  Servers MAY
      coalesce resource change notifications to multiple resources into
      a single notification resource.  The CS:updated element optionally
      contains CS:content and/or DAV:prop elements to indicate a change
      to the body of the resource or resource WebDAV properties,
      respectively.  The DAV:prop element MAY contain a list of property
      elements to indicate which properties changed.  The CS:updated
      element can also contain zero or more CS:calendar-changes elements
      to list details of the changes.  If no CS:calendar-changes element
      is present, the specific details are not provided, and clients
      will need to assume that some set of changes occurred, but the
      server is unwilling to disclose the full details.  The CS:deleted
      element can also contain zero or more CS:deleted-details elements
      to list details of the deleted resource.

   Example:  This is an example of the body of a notification resource
      for changes where one resource has been created, two updated, and
      one deleted.  One of the updated resources elements contains
      additional information indicating which recurrence instances in
      the iCalendar data were changed:

   Namespace:  http://calendarserver.org/ns/

   Purpose:  Indicates which portions of an calendar object resource
      have changed, or provides details of deleted calendar object
      resources.

   Description:  This XML element is used in a CS:updated element to
      describe how a calendar object resource changed, or in a CS:
      deleted element to provide details of a deleted resource.  It can
      identify the master instance, or individual recurrence instances,
      and for each indicate which iCalendar properties and parameters
      changed during the update for which the notification was
      generated.  For details of handling recurrences please see
      Section 5.3.2.1.

   Definition:

       <!ELEMENT calendar-changes (recurrence+) >

       <!ELEMENT recurrence
           ((master | recurrenceid), added?, removed?, changes?)>
       <!-- Which instances were affected by the change,
            and details on the per-instance changes -->

       <!ELEMENT master EMPTY>
       <!-- The "master" instance was affected -->

       <!ELEMENT recurrenceid CDATA>
       <!-- RECURRENCE-ID value for the affected instance -->

       <!ELEMENT added EMPTY>
       <!-- The component was added -->

       <!ELEMENT removed EMPTY>
       <!-- The component was removed -->

   Example:  This example indicates that a non-recurring component, or
      the master component in a recurring component, was changed and
      that the change was to the "SUMMARY" iCalendar property.

   <CS:calendar-changes xmlns:CS="http://calendarserver.org/ns/">
     <CS:recurrence>
       <CS:master/>
       <CS:changes>
         <CS:changed-property name="SUMMARY"/>
       </CS:changes>
     <CS:recurrence/>
   </CS:calendar-changes>

   Example:  This example indicates that an instance of a recurring
      component was changed and that the change was to the "DTSTART"
      iCalendar property.

   <CS:calendar-changes xmlns:CS="http://calendarserver.org/ns/">
     <CS:recurrence>
       <CS:recurrenceid>20111215T160000Z</CS:recurrenceid>
       <CS:changes>
         <CS:changed-property name="DTSTART"/>
       </CS:changes>
     <CS:recurrence/>
   </CS:calendar-changes>

5.3.2.1.  Handling Recurrences in CS:calendar-changes

   Changes to recurring components can be complex.  This section
   describes the possible set of changes that could occur, and what the
   CS:calendar-changes element will contain as a result.

   Master exists, unchanged override added  In this case, a CS:
      recurrence element will be present, containing a CS:recurrence-id
      element with a value equal to the RECURRENCE-ID property value (in
      UTC) of the added component.  A CS:added element will be present.
      There will not be any CS:removed or CS:changes elements.

   Master exists, changed override added  In this case, a CS:recurrence
      element will be present, containing a CS:recurrence-id element
      with a value equal to the RECURRENCE-ID property value (in UTC) of
      the added component.  Both CS:added and CS:changes elements will
      be present.  There will not be a CS:removed element.

   Master exists, override changed  In this case, a CS:recurrence
      element will be present, containing a CS:recurrence-id element
      with a value equal to the RECURRENCE-ID property value (in UTC) of
      the added component.  A CS:changes element will be present.  There

                          CalDAV Notifications              January 2012


      will not be any CS:added or CS:removed elements.

   Master exists, override removed  In this case, a CS:recurrence
      element will be present, containing a CS:recurrence-id element
      with a value equal to the RECURRENCE-ID property value (in UTC) of
      the added component.  A CS:removed element will be present.  There
      will not be a CS:added element.  A CS:changes element will only be
      present if the removed component differs from the "derived" master
      instance.

   Master exists, override cancelled  In this case, a CS:recurrence
      element will be present, containing a CS:recurrence-id element
      with a value equal to the RECURRENCE-ID property value (in UTC) of
      the added component.  A CS:removed element will be present.  There
      will not be any CS:added or CS:changes element.  There will also
      be a CS:master element present, with an appropriate CS:changes
      element, likely covering a change to "RRULE" or addition of
      "EXDATE" properties.

   Master does not exist, override added  In this case, a CS:recurrence
      element will be present, containing a CS:recurrence-id element
      with a value equal to the RECURRENCE-ID property value (in UTC) of
      the added component.  A CS:added element will be present.  There
      will not be a CS:removed or CS:changes element.

   Master does not exist, override changed  In this case, a CS:
      recurrence element will be present, containing a CS:recurrence-id
      element with a value equal to the RECURRENCE-ID property value (in
      UTC) of the added component.  A CS:changes element will be
      present.  There will not be any CS:added or CS:removed elements.

   Master does not exist, override removed  In this case, a CS:
      recurrence element will be present, containing a CS:recurrence-id
      element with a value equal to the RECURRENCE-ID property value (in
      UTC) of the added component.  A CS:removed element will be
      present.  There will not be any CS:added or CS:changes element.

5.3.3.  CS:deleted-details Element Definition

   Name:  deleted-details

   Namespace:  http://calendarserver.org/ns/

   Purpose:  Provides summary information about a deleted resource.







Daboo                                                          [Page 16]

   Description:  This XML element is used in a CS:deleted element to
      describe specific summary information about a deleted resource, so
      clients can provide a meaningful notification message to users.

   Definition:

       <!ELEMENT deleted-details (deleted-component, deleted-summary,
                                  deleted-next-instance?,
                                  deleted-had-more-instances?) >

       <!ELEMENT deleted-component CDATA>
       <!-- The main calendar component type of the deleted
            resource, e.g., "VEVENT", "VTODO" -->

       <!ELEMENT deleted-summary CDATA>
       <!-- Indicates the "SUMMARY" of the next future instance at the
            time of deletion, or the previous instance if no future
            instances existed at the time of deletion. -->

       <!ELEMENT deleted-next-instance CDATA>
       <!-- If present indicates the UTC date-time, or date value for
            the "RECURRENCE-ID" of the next future instance at the time
            of deletion. If not present, then there were no future
            instances at the time of deletion. -->

       <!ELEMENT deleted-had-more-instances CDATA>
       <!-- If present indicates that there was more than one future
            instances still to occur at the time of deletion. -->



   Example:  This example indicates shows deletion of a non-recurring
      event that was yet to occur at the time of deletion.

   <CS:deleted-details xmlns:CS="http://calendarserver.org/ns/">
     <CS:deleted-component>VEVENT</CS:deleted-component>
     <CS:deleted-summary>Birthday Party</CS:deleted-summary>
     <CS:deleted-next-instance>20120505</CS:deleted-next-instance>
   </CS:deleted-details>

5.3.4.  CS:notify-changes Property

   Name:  notify-changes

   Namespace:  http://calendarserver.org/ns/






Daboo                                                          [Page 17]

                          CalDAV Notifications              January 2012


   Purpose:  Allows a user to specify whether resource change
      notifications are generated by the server.

   Protected:  This property MUST NOT be protected.

   PROPFIND behavior:  This property SHOULD NOT be returned by a
      PROPFIND allprop request (as defined in Section 14.2 of
      [RFC4918]).

   COPY/MOVE behavior:  This property value MUST be preserved in COPY
      and MOVE operations.

   Description:  This property allows a user to enable or disable the
      server generation of resource change notifications for the
      calendar collection, and all its child resources, on which the
      property resides.  If the property is not present on a calendar
      collection, the client and server MUST assume that resource change
      notifications are enabled.

   Definition:

   <!ELEMENT notify-changes (true|false)>
     <!ELEMENT true EMPTY>
     <!ELEMENT false EMPTY>

   <!-- true - notifications enabled,
        false - notifications disabled -->


6.  Security Considerations

   Some notification mechanisms might allow a user to trigger a
   notification to be delivered to other users (e.g., an invitation to
   share a calendar).  In such cases servers MUST ensure that suitable
   limits are placed on the number and frequency of such user generated
   notifications.

   TBD: More?


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any actions on the part of IANA.
