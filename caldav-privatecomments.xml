                This document defines an extension to CalDAV Scheduling that enables Attendees to communicate private comments back to an Organizer, and for the Organizer to see each Attendees' comments.

            <t>
                Internet calendaring and scheduling standards are defined by <xref target="RFC2445">iCalendar</xref> and <xref target="RFC2446">iTIP</xref>. The <xref target="RFC4791">CalDAV Access</xref> standard defines a way to access calendar data stored on a server, and the <xref target="I-D.desruisseaux-caldav-sched">CalDAV Scheduling</xref> draft defines how scheduling occurs between users of a CalDAV server.
            </t>
            <t>
                It is often the case that an Attendee of an event wants to communicate information back to an Organizer when they respond to a meeting invitation. Sometimes this is to tell the Organizer the reason why an invite was declined, sometimes to add addition information to an acceptance. Typically these communications are expected to be private as they may contain comments about other Attendees.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification defines new iCalendar properties and parameters that are used by clients to pass private comments between Attendees and Organizers of events being scheduling via CalDAV scheduling. It also defines an extension to CalDAV scheduling that defines how a server automatically processes the comments to ensure they are communicated properly between the Attendee and Organizer.

                <t>When an Attendee wants to send a private comment to an Organizer, the Attendee's calendar user agent adds or updates an "X-CALENDARSERVER-PRIVATE-COMMENT" property in each calendar component of a scheduling object resource to which the comment applies. The value of the comment is the actual message the Attendee is sending.</t>
                <t>The addition or update of any "X-CALENDARSERVER-PRIVATE-COMMENT" property causes the server to send a scheduling message to the Organizer as an iTIP "REPLY", and that MUST include the "X-CALENDARSERVER-PRIVATE-COMMENT" properties in addition to the normal properties sent as part of that scheduling message.</t>

                <t>When a scheduling message from an Attendee is processed by the server, the server will check for the presence of a "X-CALENDARSERVER-PRIVATE-COMMENT" property in each component of the scheduling message and compare this with the scheduling object resource corresponding to the scheduling message currently stored on a live calendar belonging to the Organizer. For each component in the scheduling message, the server will identify the corresponding component in the scheduling object resource (possibly creating a new overridden component instance if needed) and do the following:</t>
