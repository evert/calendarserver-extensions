                This document defines an extension to CalDAV Scheduling that adds a change summary for scheduling messages automatically processed by the server. It can be used by clients to provide a detailed indication to a calendar user of how a calendar object was changed by auto-processing of a scheduling message.

            <t>
                Internet calendaring and scheduling standards are defined by <xref target="RFC2445">iCalendar</xref> and <xref target="RFC2446">iTIP</xref>. The <xref target="RFC4791">CalDAV Access</xref> standard defines a way to access calendar data stored on a server, and the <xref target="I-D.desruisseaux-caldav-sched">CalDAV Scheduling</xref> draft defines how scheduling occurs between users of a CalDAV server.
            </t>
            <t>
                In CalDAV Scheduling, scheduling messages sent between calendar users can be automatically processed by the CalDAV server. Often clients need to provide an indication to the user of what changed when such auto-processing occurs (e.g. to inform the user that an event was re-scheduling or cancelled). Sometimes the client does not have the old copy of the automatically updated calendar object to hand, so as a result it can't determine changes itself.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification defines a new WebDAV property on scheduling messages stored in a calendar users scheduling Inbox collection. This property is automatically generated by the server and contains XML data representing the key changes made by the server when it auto-processed the scheduling message. Clients can use the data in this property to provide an indication to a calendar user as to what changed.

        <section title="New behavior">
            <t>When a CalDAV scheduling server automatically processes a scheduling message in a scheduling inbox collection, it SHOULD determine what changes were applied to the matching scheduling object resource and create an XML data value (as described next) and store that in the CS:schedule-changes property on the scheduling message resource. When a client checks the scheduling inbox collection to look for scheduling messages that need to be acknowledged by a calendar user, the client MAY check for the presence of the CS:schedule-changes and retrieve its value via a PROPFIND or CALDAV:multiget REPORT request. The XML data value can then be parsed and useful information extracted and presented to the user in whatever way is appropriate for the client.</t>
