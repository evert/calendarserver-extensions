                This specification defines an extension to CalDAV that makes it easy for clients to setup and manage calendar user proxies, using the WebDAV Access Control List extension as a basis.

            <t>
                <xref target="RFC4791">CalDAV</xref> provides a way for calendar users to store calendar data and exchange this data via scheduling operations. Based on the WebDAV protocol <xref target='RFC2518' />, it also includes the ability to manage access to calendar data via the WebDAV ACL extension <xref target='RFC3744' />.
            </t>
            <t>
                It is often common for a calendar user to delegate some form of responsibility for their calendar and schedules to another calendar user (e.g., a boss allows an assistant to check a calendar or to send and accept scheduling invites on his behalf). The user handling the calendar data on behalf of someone else is often referred to as a "calendar user proxy".
            </t>
            <t>
                Whilst CalDAV does have fine-grained access control features that can be used to setup complex sharing and management of calendars, often the proxy behavior required is an "all-or-nothing" approach - i.e. the proxy has access to all the calendars or to no calendars (in which case they are of course not a proxy). So a simple way to manage access to an entire set of calendars and scheduling ability would be handy.
            </t>
            <t>
                In addition, calendar user agents will often want to display to a user who has proxy access to their calendars, or to whom they are acting as a proxy. Again, CalDAV's access control discovery and report features can be used to do that, but with fine-grained control that exists, it can be hard to tell who is a "real" proxy as opposed to someone just granted rights to some subset of calendars. Again, a simple way to discover proxy information would be handy.

                    For each calendar user principal on the server, the server will generate two group principals - "proxy groups". One is used to hold the list of principals who have read-only proxy access to the main principal's calendars, the other holds the list of principals who have read-write and scheduling proxy access. NB these new group principals would have no equivalent in Open Directory.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Privileges on each "proxy group" principal will be set so that the "owner" has the ability to change property values.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The "proxy group" principals will be child resources of the user principal resource with specific resource types and thus are easy to discover. As a result the user principal resources will also be collection resources.
                </t>
                <t>
                    When provisioning the calendar user home collection, the server will:

                        <t>
                            Add an ACE to the calendar home collection giving the read-write "proxy group" inheritable read-write access.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            Add an ACE to each of the calendar Inbox and Outbox collections giving the <xref target='I-D.desruisseaux-caldav-sched'>CALDAV:schedule privilege</xref> to the read-write "proxy group".

                    A client can see who the proxies are for the current principal by examining the principal resource for the two "proxy group" properties and then looking at the DAV:group-member-set property of each.

                <t>
                    The client can edit the list of proxies for the current principal by editing the DAV:group-member-set property on the relevant "proxy group" principal resource.

                <t>
                    The client can find out who the current principal is a proxy for by running a DAV:principal-match REPORT on the principal collection.

                        Do we want to separate read-write access to calendars vs the ability to schedule as a proxy?

                        There is no way for a proxy to be able to manage the list of proxies. We could allow the main calendar user DAV:write-acl on their "proxy group" principals, in which case they could grant others the right to modify the group membership.

                        Should the "proxy group" principals also be collections given that the regular principal resources will be?

                    Each "regular" principal resource that needs to allow calendar user proxy support MUST be a collection resource. i.e. in addition to including the DAV:principal XML element in the DAV:resourcetype property on the resource, it MUST also include the DAV:collection XML element.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Each "regular" principal resource MUST contain two child resources with names "calendar-proxy-read" and "calendar-proxy-write" (note that these are only suggested names - the server could choose any unique name for these). These resources are themselves principal resources that are groups contain the list of principals for calendar users who can act as a read-only or read-write proxy respectively.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The server MUST include the CS:calendar-proxy-read or CS:calendar-proxy-write XML elements in the DAV:resourcetype property of the child resources, respectively. This allows clients to discover the "proxy group" principals by using a PROPFIND, Depth:1 request on the current user's principal resource and requesting the DAV:resourcetype property be returned. The element type declarations are:

                </t>
                <t>
                    The server MUST allow the "parent" principal to change the DAV:group-member-set property on each of the "child" "proxy group" principal resources. When a principal is listed as a member of the "child" resource, the server MUST include the "child" resource URI in the DAV:group-membership property on the included principal resource. Note that this is just "normal" behavior for a group principal.
                </t>
                <t>
                    An example principal resource layout might be:

                  calendar-proxy-read

                    </figure>
                    If the principal "cyrus" wishes to have the principal "red" act as a calendar user proxy on his behalf and have the ability to change items on his calendar or schedule meetings on his behalf, then he would add the principal resource URI for "red" to the DAV:group-member-set property of the principal resource /principals/users/cyrus/calendar-proxy-write, giving:
                    <figure>
                        <artwork><![CDATA[
<DAV:group-member-set>

</DAV:group-member-set>
                        ]]></artwork>
                    </figure>
                    The DAV:group-membership property on the resource /principals/users/red/ would be:
                    <figure>
                        <artwork><![CDATA[
<DAV:group-membership>
  <DAV:href>/principals/users/cyrus/calendar-proxy-write</DAV:href>
</DAV:group-membership>
                        ]]></artwork>
                    </figure>
                </t>
                <t>
                    If the principal "red" was also a read-only proxy for the principal "wilfredo", then the DA:group-membership property on the resource /principals/users/red/ would be:
                    <figure>
                        <artwork><![CDATA[
<DAV:group-membership>

</DAV:group-membership>

                    </figure>
                    Thus a client can discover to which principals a particular principal is acting as a calendar user proxy for by examining the DAV:group-membership property.
                </t>
                <t>
                    An alternative to discovering which principals a user can proxy as is to use the WebDAV ACL principal-match report, targeted at the principal collections available on the server.
