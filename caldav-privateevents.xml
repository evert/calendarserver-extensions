                This document defines an extension to CalDAV that enables a client to mark events with an access classification (e.g., "private") so that other calendar users have restricted rights to view the data in the calendar component.

            <t>
                Internet calendaring and scheduling standards are defined by <xref target="RFC5545">iCalendar</xref> and <xref target="RFC5546">iTIP</xref>. The <xref target="RFC4791">CalDAV</xref> standard defines a way to access calendar data stored on a server. CalDAV uses <xref target="RFC3744">WebDAV ACLs</xref> to allow a calendar user to grant rights to other users to see the calendar data stored on the server. This is an "all or nothing" behavior, i.e. if another user is granted the DAV:read privilege to a calendar component, then that user can read all the calendar data in the calendar resource stored on the server.
            </t>
            <t>
                It is often the case that a calendar user wants to give "restricted" access to portions of the calendar data. e.g., allow another calendar user to see only the start and end times of an event, but not other information (such as summary, description, location, attendee list etc). There is currently no way to do that with CalDAV.
            </t>
            <t>
            	This specification defines a new iCalendar property that can be stored in a calendar component on the CalDAV server that triggers restricted access rights for other users., in addition to the standard rights granted by WebDAV ACLs. In some cases use of this property will result in the server implicitly changing the WebDAV ACLs granted by users.

				<t>This specification introduces a new iCalendar property "X-CALENDARSERVER-ACCESS" that can be used only as a property in a "VCALENDAR" object.</t>
				<section title="Changes to VCALENDAR Object">
					<t>The definition of the properties allowed in a "VCALENDAR" object is extended as follows:
					<figure>
						<artwork><![CDATA[
     calprops   /= 

                ; 'access'is optional,

						]]></artwork>
					</figure>
					Note that the property is applied to the top-level "VCALENDAR" object which means that the access rights being set apply to the entire iCalendar object (and thus entire CalDAV resource) when stored on a CalDAV server. This specification does not define a way to restrict access on a per-component or per-instance basis within a single CalDAV calendar resource.
					</t>
				</section>
				<section title='Restricted Access Property'>

					<t>Property Name: X-CALENDARSERVER-ACCESS</t>
	
					<t>Purpose: The property is used to indicate restricted access rights to the iCalendar data.</t>
	
					<t>Value Type: TEXT</t>
	
					<t>Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be specified on this property.</t>
	
					<t>Conformance: The property can be specified at most once in an iCalendar object.</t>
	
					<t>Description: The access property is used to restrict access to the calendar data when it is stored on a CalDAV server only. Note that this property has no meaning when used in other types of calendar store or when sent via an iTIP message. When used on a CalDAV server, the CalDAV server guarantees that the appropriate calendar data access restrictions are applied based on the value of this property.</t>
					<t>The access values are defined as follows:</t>
					<texttable>
						<ttcol>Access Value</ttcol>
						<ttcol>Description</ttcol>
						<c>PUBLIC</c>
						<c>All of the calendar data is visible.</c>
						<c>&nbsp;</c>
						<c>&nbsp;</c>
						<c>PRIVATE</c>
						<c>None of the calendar data is visible.</c>
						<c>&nbsp;</c>
						<c>&nbsp;</c>
						<c>CONFIDENTIAL</c>
						<c>Only start and end time of each instance is visible.</c>
						<c>&nbsp;</c>
						<c>&nbsp;</c>
						<c>RESTRICTED</c>
						<c>Only start and end time, summary and location of each instance is visible.</c>
					</texttable>
					<t>Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:
					<figure>
						<artwork><![CDATA[
  access = "X-CALENDARSERVER-ACCESS" accessparam ":" accessvalue CRLF

  accessparam = *(";" xparam)

  accessvalue = "PUBLIC" / "PRIVATE" / "CONFIDENTIAL" / "RESTRICTED"
                / x-name
  ;Default is PUBLIC

        <section title='Security Considerations'>
            <t>
              It is not possible to have private events in a calendar Inbox collection as the "X-CALENDARSERVER-ACCESS" iCalendar property cannot be used in an iTIP message sent via CalDAV scheduling. As a result, any one with read access to the calendar Inbox collection will be able to see all the calendar data in any calendar resource in that collection.
            </t>
            <t>
              This specification leaves open the possibility of having additional standard or non-standard values for the "X-CALENDARSERVER-ACCESS" iCalendar property. This possibility requires special attention by servers and clients, as detailed below:
              <list style='symbols'>
                <t>Servers MUST reject any iCalendar component with an "X-CALENDARSERVER-ACCESS" property value that is not recognized.</t>
                <t>Clients MUST accept and preserve any "X-CALENDARSERVER-ACCESS" property values in iCalendar data. In the case of a value that the client does not recognize, the following actions can be taken:
				<list>
  				  <t>Present the access state to the user in an "indeterminate" state and allow them to change it to any of the values known to the client. However, if the user chooses not to change it, the original value MUST be preserved.</t>
				  <t>Treat the unknown value as "PUBLIC".</t>
				</list>
			    </t>
              </list>
			</t>
			<t>
			  The access restrictions defined here are dependent on the value of the DAV:owner property on a calendar resource. Servers MUST ensure that this property value cannot be changed by unauthorized users. Ideally it could be treated as a "live" property whose value can never be changed via WebDAV protocol.
